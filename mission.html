<h2><strong> Mission Statement </strong></h2><hr>
<p4>In Leeds, where LevelUp was founded, the proportion of students receiving free school meals (FSM) is 14.1%<a href=”https://www.suttontrust.com/research-paper/appg-social-mobility-closing-the-regional-attainment-gap/” id="a">(1)</a>. Of this percentage those achieving 9-5 in Maths and English GCSE is 17.8%. The standard requirement to progress to further education, namely Sixth form or College (16-18) is achieving 9-5 grades, the reality is not acceptable. Department for Education data<a href=”https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/757897/WP2018-MainText.pdf
” id="a">(2)</a> has shown that in 2017 just 25.6% of 19-year-olds who were eligible for FSM at 15-years of age were in higher education. The gap in progression rates between FSM and non-FSM pupils has remained at 17.7 percentage points over the past three years. These statistics highlight the national crisis and the need for interventions for students at risk of non-continuation.
<br><br>
Our mission is to empower, support, and inspire young people in the North of England specifically in areas where a high percentage of pupils are eligible for <a href=”https://www.entitledto.co.uk/help/free-school-meals” id="a">free-school meals</a>.
<br><br>
As first-generation students ourselves, we appreciate the struggle required to break through the cycle and succeed with limited help in our home and school life. We also appreciate the impact of mentors in the lives of young people and see the potential of mentoring schemes to support students through the difficult stages of education.

At the heart of LevelUp is our mentorship scheme. Mentoring schemes are not a new concept, though, very few offer long-standing support through the transition to adulthood. That is, from sitting GCSEs to applying for college, to finally applying for university. The LevelUp mission is to establish a secure contact between the mentor and mentee so that during these times the mentee feels able to consult their mentor for unconditional advice. We believe that mentorship works best when there isn’t too much of a developmental gap, so our mentors are all University students and only a few steps ahead. By introducing mentee and mentor and encouraging the development of the mentorship, we hope to provide the pupil with guidance, ensuring that they stay on track to achieve their goals. The final stages of high-school are a crucial time for encouragement as final year exams are an anxiety inducing experience, especially for those pupils that are unsure of what the future holds and how to achieve their goals. Thus, this scheme is motivated by this unique stage of life, where the introduction of a knowledgeable yet relatable mentor could be vital in keeping the student determined.
<br><br>
We have made it our intention to pair our mentees with mentors from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. We believe that mentoring works best when the mentor can truly empathise with the mentee from past experience, and more importantly, we want to ensure that the mentee sees their own potential by relating to the mentors’ past experiences. With wide-scale development, this project has the potential to expand to allow more selective partnerships, (matching students based on more personal criteria i.e. BAME, disability, carers). We are motivated in ensuring young pupils from less advantaged backgrounds fulfil their potential, by providing compassionate mentors that can have a significant and transformative impact on their academic and professional development.
<br><br>
We recognise inequality, <i> as we have lived it</i>, and now our mission is to reduce it. We aim to act as an impetus for our young participants to strive for bigger and better, and together, we can reduce the cyclical nature of class inequality in education.
